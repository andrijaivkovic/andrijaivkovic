Hi, I’m Andrija Ivković! I'm an El. Eng. graduate based in Belgrade.<br>
 I'm interested in frontend development, web design and motion design. <br>
<hr>
I'm currently improving the knowlege I gained in college by going through <br> 
Jonas Schmedtmann's courses on Udemy and completing the challenges <br>
provided on https://www.frontendmentor.io/ <br><br>

Courses that I plan on taking:

I'm not currently taking any courses.

Completed Courses:

- **'The Complete JavaScript Course' by Jonas Schmedtmann** <br>

- **'React - The Ultimate Guide' by Jonas Schmedtmann** <br>

Courses that I'm currently going through:

- **'JavaScript: The Advanced Concepts' by Andrei Neagoie** <br>
&nbsp;By taking this course I aim to get the more advanced knowledge of JavaScript and programming <br>
&nbsp;in general, not just in web development.
