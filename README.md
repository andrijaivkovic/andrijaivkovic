Hi, I’m Andrija Ivković! I'm a CS student that is about to graduate.<br>
I'm interested in front-end development, video editing, web design and graphics design. <br>
<hr>
I'm currently improving the knowlege I gained in college by going through <br> 
Jonas Schmedtmann's courses on Udemy and completing the challenges <br>
provided on https://www.frontendmentor.io/ <br><br>

Courses that I plan on taking:

Completed Courses:

- **'The Complete JavaScript Course' by Jonas Schmedtmann** <br>
&nbsp;In this course I learned the basics of JavaScript for frontend development.

- **'React - The Ultimate Guide' by Jonas Schmedtmann** <br>
&nbsp;By taking this course I get upto speed with one of the most used <br>
&nbsp;frontend frameworks: React.js. I also learned some advanced topics in React realm<br>
&nbsp; such as routing with React Router, state management with Redux and data fetching with React Query.

Courses that I'm currently going through:

- **'JavaScript: The Advanced Concepts' by Andrei Neagoie** <br>
&nbsp;By taking this course I aim to get the more advanced knowledge of JavaScript and programming <br>
&nbsp;in general, not just in web development.
